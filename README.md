# RescuePet_Dashboard

### Description
The RescuePet_Dashboard is an interactive web application designed to help animal shelters manage and visualize their data effectively. Developed using Python, Dash, and Plotly within Jupyter Notebooks & Spyder, this dashboard provides a comprehensive solution for tracking and analyzing animal rescue operations. Users can filter rescue types, view detailed information in data tables, and explore geolocation maps of rescue events. Additionally, the application displays data in a pie chart for easy visualization of breed distributions. The application integrates with a MongoDB database to perform CRUD operations, ensuring secure and efficient management of animal records.

This project demonstrates how to use data visualization and interactive features to help animal shelters make better decisions. The dashboard is easy to understand and can be extended with new features. By using this tool, shelters can see important information about their operations, use their resources more effectively, and improve the care they provide to rescued animals.
